   ● Professor Johanna Drucker — Department chair GSE&IS, UCLA</p>
 <br><p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font size=2">Upon meeting Professor Johanna Drucker in the fall of 2017 i became 
        aware of her prolific career as an artist and writer. It seems each time we speak, i am learning of an area 
        of expertise that she holds knowledge of (extending far beyond the bibliographic career she is most well-known for) 
        that was previously unknown to me. It is this diverse knowledge bank of Professor Drucker’s that draws me to continued 
        exploration of my own skills and interests. <br>
i approached Professor Drucker to be my advisor the first quarter of my studies at UCLA and she welcomely accepted me as an 
        advisee. Her support has fostered in me a new kind of determined mindset, the sense that i can accomplish 
        whatever it is that i dream to accomplish by way of asking the right questions and continuing to learn new things, 
        (despite how difficult they may seem to learn at the outset).<br>
My background in fine art print-making led me to be appointed by Professor Drucker as the letterpress lab technician for the 
        winter, spring, and fall quarters of 2018. This opportunity gave me the chance to teach, facilitate my creative work, 
        and practice patience. <br>
When Professor Drucker announced via the information studies listserv e-mail an opportunity to travel to upstate New York for a
        weekend long consortium of information professionals at the Women's Studio Workshop, i contacted her right away — 
        expressing my enthusiasm to attend. After discussing this opportunity during one of our regular meetings, i was granted
        the invitation to represent the students at UCLA on the trip and come back to develop a recommendation report with two 
        of my peers, Dianne Weinthal and Micaela Rogers. This experience marked my first participation within a group of 
        librarians, archivists, and special collections managers, as well as my first trip to New York state. 
It was also Professor Drucker’s introduction to HTML in her History Of The Book course that led me to begin 
        strengthening my skills learned on the job as the Hammer Museum’s DAMS assistant and pursue a digital humanities 
        certificate at UCLA. <br>
Although she left California for sabbatical this winter, we have remained in touch and discussed my career goals and 
        development via e-mail and on the telephone. Professor Druckers unwavering support and guidance continues to 
        propel me towards setting & achieving my highest goals.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font-size:18px">● Phillip Leers — Project Manager for Digital Initiaves, Hammer Museum</p><br>
        <p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font size=2">After working nearly 5 years at the Hammer Museum bookstore, i applied to a 
          position as the Digital Asset Management Systems (DAMS) Assitant for the curatorial department. My supervisor, Phillip 
          Leers, has been an invaluable professional advisor and champion of my work. Phillip, who holds masters degrees in both 
          information studies and film studies, and has been <a href="https://twitter.com/altitudemadness/status/1001570252180807680">
          offering his service as a copy-editor</a> to give suggestions on the cover letters and/or personal statements for any student 
          or new-professional entering into the arts, film, or digital humanities workforce. <b> Togeter, we have developed a new user 
          guide for training staff at the Hammer museum in using our DAMS (NetX), a list of controlled vocabulary terms for tagging 
          events and programs images, as well as oversee over 100,000 assets. Philip has provided me with a set of professional 
          best-practices tools that have afforded me recognition within our department and others at Hammer for the contributions I 
          make within our digital archives. He has continued to nudge me into the right direction while allowing me the trust and
          responsibility to make decisions of my own in our daily work. Philip’s validation of my work as valuable to our instiution 
          continues to bring me pride and steers me towards pursing a career path working with digital datasets and online repositories. </p>
        <br><p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font-size:18px">● Yolanda Bustos — Archivist, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County
        </p><br<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font size=2">In the summer of 2018 i volunteered to assist in an on-going digitization
        project at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Here, i met Yolanda Bustos, Archivist of their collections. Albeit
        brief, this experience has significantly influenced the direction i am looking to take with my professional career. Seeing Yolanda
        at work reminded me of the many hats a single archivist needs often to wear. By way of Yolanda's excellent communication and
        relations skills,i quickly felt a sense of camaraderie and belonging to the profession of record-keepers. Yolanda frequently
        asked about my interests and offered insight into keeping an art practice alongsige a full-time carrer. She continues to
        be a person who shares with me new opportunities and upcoming events within the Los Angeles art & archives communities.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next';font-size:18px"> ● Jennifer Martinez Wormser — Director of Ella Strong Denison Library, SCRIPPS</p>
<br>My very first advisor in the field of information studies was, at the time, the library director of my alma mater: 
Laguna College of Art + Design. Jennifer Martinez Wormser offered her mentorship throughout my application process and current
studies at UCLA. Jennifer agreed to participate in an oral history interview process for Professor Mary N. Maack's 
Feminist Research Methods course. During our interview we discussed, in depth, her practice as an information professional and
offered insight into motherhood, partnership, and a full-time career. Without Jennifer's support of my art practice and understanding
of the critical role archives played in fostering my work - i most certainly would not be composing this portfolio for advancement to
candidacy at UCLA.</p>
