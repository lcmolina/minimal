This site was designed with sensitivity to screen essential readers. That is to say color is not necessarily a cue to signified differentiated information but for aesthetic purpose. The color used in this site may be thought of as “inverted” from the norm, black text on white background. Some scientific evidence may even prove that <a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/">high contrast black text on white backgrounds</a> may cause significant eye strain for the increasingly screen reading essentialised person.
However, it is not yet scientifically proven. All the visual elements have alttext written into the html source code. as for the video components, i have included alttext in form of a description of what can be seen in the moving pictures as well as a linked PDF to the script of the one instance of video that includes audio. 
				      Using <a href=" http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)</a>, i have checked each page of the site for errors and corrected each using their recommendations for repair. 
There are two aspects of my site intentionally made somewhat illegible. First is the credit for hosting on github and theme author. These credits have been set very small so as not to distract from the critical elements of this portfolio. If it seems that i am not crediting github or the jekyll theme creator, i’ve intentionally chosen not to purchase a custom domain name and leave github within my page URL so that viewers are aware of the platform i’ve used for hosting and building this site. The second is on the front page “lcmolina.github.io/portfolio” where it reads “a digital” above “portfolio”. These words are set small as an aesthic decision to cue what is already obvious about this portfolio. If a reader cannot read the subtitle text on the home page, it is somewhat intentional — as it needs not be read to be understood.<br>
