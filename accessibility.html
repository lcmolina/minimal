        <p style="font-family: 'Avenir Next'; color:#edf968">to navigate this site:</p>
        
           <ul style="font-family: 'Avenir Next';color:#ffffff; font size='2'">
	<li>this site consists of a total of 8 interlinked pages.</li>
	<li>each page can be called upon by the page name on the left column (or, if viewing on mobile, top column). </li>
	<li>alternatively, each page can be called upon by typing the page name sans punctuation and/or spaces ex:"/pagename" after the URL.
	(i.e.: “lcmolina.github.io/portfolio” navigate to who? page “lcmoling.github.io/portfolio/who”) </li>

	<li>once a viewer has reached the desired page, they can scroll through the contents of each page.</li>
	<li>some pages have more than one sub-section and others only contain one sub-section.</li>
	<li>sub-suctions are flagged by chraracters of a different color. if this illegible, they are flagged by characters of a larger size.</li>
	<li>any long-form texts or projects (i.e. papers, scripts, external pages) have been given hyperlinks that open in a new window.</li>
	<li>a viewer can navigate backwards or forwards between pages using their browser’s back or forward buttons or by repeating either of the above processes to inter-linked pages.</li></ul 
        <br>        <p style="font-family: 'Avenir Next'; color:#edf968">accessibility statement</p>
		              <p style="font-family: 'Avenir Next';color:#ffffff">
This site was designed with sensitivity to the screen essential reader. That is to say that color is not necessarily a cue 
signify differentiated information but mainly for aesthetic purpose. The colors used in this site may be thought of as
 “inverted” from the norm; black text on white background. Some scientific evidence may prove that 
 <a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/">high contrast black 
	 text on white backgrounds</a> may cause significant eye strain for the increasingly screen essentialised person.
However, it is not yet scientifically proven. All the visual elements have alttext written into the html source codes. As
				      for the video components, i have included alttext in form of a description 
				      of what mayc be seen in the moving pictures as well as a linked PDF to the script of
				      the one instance of video with audio compnent. 
				      Using <a href=" http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)</a>, 
				      i have checked each page of the site for errors and corrected each using WAVE's 
				      recommendations for repair. 
There are two aspects of my site intentionally made, somewhat, illegible. First is the credit for hosting on github 
				      and theme author that is located at the bottom left of each page. These credits have 
				      been set very small so as not to distract from the critical elements of this portfolio. 
				      If it seems that i am not crediting github or the jekyll theme creator, i’ve 
				      intentionally chosen not to purchase a custom domain name and leave github within my 
				      page URL so that viewers are aware of the platform i’ve used for hosting and building 
				      this site. The second instance of small type is on the frontmost facing page, 
				      “lcmolina.github.io/portfolio”, where it reads “a digital” above “portfolio”. These words
				      are set small as an aesthic decision to signify what is already obvious about this portfolio. 
				      If a reader cannot read the subtitle text on the home page, it is intentional — as it 
				      need not to be read to be understood.<br>
