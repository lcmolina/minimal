Within the archives is where we hope to find artifacts and the more ephemeral substances that photographs often are associated with. Looking at the photographic works of artist, Sarah Charlesworth as a starting point for the redefinition of the arrangement of archival material to show how a serial typology becomes its own archival series, I composed this paper as a way to compare the works of visual artists to the scholarly definitions of “record-keeping" and ask: How can looking at artists, like Charlesworth, through an archival lens expand record-keeping strategies through art-making practices?

This paper is written with the purpose of examining an area within my professional practice that i believe to be the enduring and contemporary issue of locating interdiscipline and finding spaces that embrace the work of interdisciplinarians rather than exploit their unique practices. In this paper, i discuss definitions of interdiscipline and the identity of interdisciplinarians. i also consider the invisibility of interdisciplinarians and how the concept of collaboration is critical to understand in making work more visible. The paper concludes with a call to educating institutions to better practice interdiscipline in a way that might be applicable to professional success (particularly in the LIS field).<br>
