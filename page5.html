   ● Professor Johanna Drucker, Department chair GSE&IS, UCLA
 <br><p style=;"font-family:'Avenir Next';font-size:12px">Upon meeting Professor Johanna Drucker in the fall of 2017 i became aware of her prolific career as an artist and writer. it seems each time we meet or speak, i am learning of aa area of expertise that she holds knowledge of - extending far beyond the bibliographic career she is most well-known for - that was previously unknown to me. It is this diverse knowledge bank of Professor Drucker’s that draws me to continued exploration of my own skills and interests. 
i approached Professor Drucker to be my advisor the first quarter of my studies and she was welcoming and accepted me as an advisee. Her support has fostered in me a new kind of determined mindset, the sense that i can really accomplish whatever it is that i want to accomplish as long as i ask the right question and to always continue to learn new things, despite how difficult they may seem to learn at the outset.
My background in fine art print-making led me to be appointed by Professor Drucker as the letterpress lab technician for the winter, spring, and fall quarters of 2018. This opportunity gave me the chance to teach, facilitate my art practice, and gather up my patience. 
When Professor Drucker announced via the information studies listserv e-mail an opportunity to travel to upstate New York for a weekend long consortium of information professionals at the Women's Studio Workshop, i contacted her right away expressing my enthusiasm to attend. We discussed it during one of our regular meetings and i was granted the invitation to represent the students at UCLA on the trip and come back to develop a recommendation report with two of my peers, Dianne Weinthal and Micaela Rogers. this experience marked my first participation within a group of librarians, archivists, and special collections managers, as well as my first trip to New York state. 
It was also Professor Drucker’s introduction to HTML in her History Of The Book course that led me to begin strengthening skills learned on the job as the Hammer Museum’s DAMS assistant and pursue the digital humanities certificate at UCLA. 
Although she left California for sabbatical this winter, we have remained in touch and discussed my career goals and development via e-mail and on the telephone. Professor Druckers unwavering support and direction continue to propel me towards setting high goals for myself and achieving them.
