<br>My art practice influences my professional persona and ARTIST is the title with which i most commonly identify.
My tendencies to create visual art out of the urge to collect, arrange, and make (re)presentions have been translated into my professional practice: to describe, maintain, and provide access to digital collections. 
  <br><br> This site is being developed to present a digital 
portfolio for a panel of persons who will assess my competencies,
research, and experiences as a professional in the field of information studies.<br>

<br>        <p style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; color:#ffffff">
As an artist, i’ve found myself deeply engaged with research and collecting. 
this aspect of my art practice led me to working with the library director during my undergraduate studies. Over the course of a single summer, i organized about two cubic feet of legacy materials to begin shaping up an archive of both institutionally related documents, reference & ephemera collected by decades of alumni, and exhibition catalogues from local galleries. This project introduced me to archiving and the feeling of accomplishment resulting from it lingered on. when i moved to Los Angeles, i unpacked an entire art studio into a small, shared, one-bedroom apartment. It was then that i began to consider continuing my education and pursuing a practice that would blend together my habitual collecting and organizing with my unquenchable thirst to create my own visual materials.

Around the same time i was  accepted to UCLA’s graduate school for information studies, i was given the opportunity to work as Hammer Museum’s Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) Assistant. Realizing the need for databases designed with the specific needs of our employee users in mind drove me to seek out a deeper understanding of what makes DAMS “work” and what doesn’t. i have become dedicated to developing useful collections for the Hammer museum’s DAMS. i was able to incorporate tools i was exposed to in Professor Lynn Boyden’s User Experience course to create workflows and decision trees into updated user guides for NetX. And, with skills learned in Professor Johanna Drucker’s Digital Methods for Research and Scholarship course, i have sourced & cleaned open access data from similar art institutions to support my work at the museum. 
But working as an arts worker has its limitations as an art maker — looking at art in my daily occupation has not been conducive to fostering an art practice of my own. 
So, as i became double conflicted by my artist identity and, my professional path, and my studies at UCLA i began to examine myself more closely. During that time, i was encouraged by professors and advisors alike to ask myself what matters to me. As it pertains to both information studies and my personal interests, i hope to steer my career towards working with professionals in  environmental monitoring and/or natural sciences, like marine biology. Multiple instances of my interest in the environment and biology can be seen manifesting itself in the projects I’ve created during my studies at UCLA in the work section of this portfolio. In October of this year, IAMSLIC (The International Association of Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers) is hosting a regional conference in Port Aransas, Texas. i plan to attend with the intention to learn about the specialization of aquatic and marine science within the information studies, libraries, and archives fields so that i can find my community and discover how my expertise can benefit a greater cause: the exploration and understanding of the places on our planet that provide all living things the conditions required to support life. In pursuit of this same goal i also intend to become a certified volunteer docent for California state parks to lead tours. If it were possible, i would like to seek out the opportunity to create informational documents with data visualisations and illustrations pulled from archival material to disperse to visitors of tide pools at places like Leo Carrillo, San Simeon, Crystal Cove, or which ever coastal park i end up residing closest to.

During the summer of 2018, i volunteered my time to work on an ongoing digitization project in the archives at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHMLA). Here, i was given my first opportunity to work hands on with at-risk materials experiencing vinegar syndrome and ensure their preservation by creating digital surrogates and placing many safety negatives into quarantine. It is my dream to find a position with an institution like NHMLA and continue to offer my own unique perspectives on strategy for management of digital collections. i have applied for an opening at NHMLA as Digital Asset Manager this spring and am hopeful to hear back before the end of the academic year.

In the winter of 2018 i traveled to Kingston, New York to participate in a weekend long consortium of archivists, librarians, and special collections workers to discuss the archival collections at Women’s Studio Workshop (WSW)  - an artist’s residency program specializing in, among other things, the art of fine-press printing and book-making. i returned from my travels to consult with two of my peers and develop, together, a document of our recommendations for the collections at WSW. This experience strengthened my knowledge of the inner-workings of community archives, alongside my internship at La Historia Historical Society Museum (LHHSM). LHHSM is home to a collection of community sourced and donated photographic materials dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. Being placed at this site for my Community Archives Lab internship has meant taking on the role as the museum’s first trained archivist. This responsibility allows for me to focus on my personal strengths, like digitization and rehousing, and practice the formal processes of arrangement and description - a skill I’ve recently had to train myself in with help from auditing a course.

Although i may eschew from being an arts worker in favor of being a practicing artist in the future, i have recently engaged in two coordinating committees which align with my arts background. The first is with the Hammer Student Association, to plan for two events: Hammer Study Hall and UCLA Arts Party. The second is for a joining of two departments to participate at the annual Los Angeles Art Book Fair - the UCLA Collective: DM|A & Information Studies. Both of these groups have been composed of graduate and undergraduate students who are interdisciplinary practitioners with creative direction. My position at Hammer as the DAMS Assistant groomed me for communicating across, the sometimes fuzzy, departmental boundaries and lexicons of persons involved in large projects. 
As i focused on in my issue paper, interdisciplinary practice often has much to do with communication and language. i believe my greatest strengths have always been my flexibility and patience for learning new modes of communication. It is of the utmost importance to me to retain my own unique lexicons and linguistic norms. Whilst studying at UCLA i have obtained a great deal of knowledge on vocabularies and firmly believe that my stepping stone into any career path i choose to to take is dependent upon the words i speak/write and when i speak/write them.</p> </section>
